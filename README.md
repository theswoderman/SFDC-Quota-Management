# SFDC-Quota-Managent
SFDC Unmanaged Package for quota management.


I put this package together for myself with the simple goal of being able to easily set quotas and compare against *ARR* as opposed of *Amount* on Opportunities. 

I have a lot of custom fields and reports built out in my instance using this functionality but they are not included in this package because the whole point is to make quota management in sfdc easy and customizable. I don't want to make users delete half the stuff I'm using before they can start using this package.
